        <h1>Welcome to the Mbed OS Documentation</h1>
        <p>
            This is the reference documentation for the Mbed OS APIs and tools, 
            to help you create and deploy IoT devices based on Arm microcontrollers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mbed OS is an open-source operating system for platforms using Arm microcontrollers designed specifically 
            for Internet of Things (IoT) devices: low-powered, constrained devices that need to connect to the internet. 
            Mbed OS provides an abstraction layer for the microcontrollers it runs on, so that developers can focus 
            on writing C/C++ applications that call functionality available on a range of hardware. 
            Mbed OS applications can be reused on any Mbed-compatible platform.

        <h3>Mbed OS 2 vs OS 5</h3>
        <p>
            Arm Mbed OS 5 is a superset of Arm Mbed OS 2. 
            This means that Mbed OS 5 is Mbed OS 2 but with more features, such as an RTOS.

                Find out more about Mbed OS versions and how to migrate from Mbed OS 2 to Mbed OS 5
